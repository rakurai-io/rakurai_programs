# Rakurai Reward Distribution Program

A Solana smart contract for distributing block rewards among **Rakurai**, **validators**, and **stakers** via per-epoch **Reward Collection Accounts (RCA)** and post-epoch Merkle claims. It also tracks on-chain tip and MevShare revenue in per-validator, per-service **Tips Collection Accounts (TCA)** and **MevShare Collection Accounts (MCA)**.

➤ For more details, refer to the [IDL File](./idl/reward_distribution.json).

## 2. How it works

Each **validator**, for each **epoch**, creates a unique PDA called `RewardCollectionAccount`:

- **Seeds**: `["REWARD_COLLECTION_ACCOUNT", validator_vote_pubkey, epoch_number]`
- Only the validator's **authorized withdrawer** can initialize it.
- When creating the account, the validator must specify:
  - `reward_merkle_root_authority` — Authority responsible for uploading the Merkle root post-epoch.
  - `block_reward_commission_bps` — Commission (in basis points) that the validator retains from block rewards.
  - `client_commission_bps` — Commission (in basis points) for client (i.e., Rakurai) from block rewards.
  - `client_commission_account` — Destination account for client commission.

> The values for `client_commission_bps`, `block_reward_commission_bps`, and `client_commission_account` are pulled from the [RakuraiActivationAccount](../rakurai_activation/README.md#4-rakurai-activation-account-creation), a validator-specific PDA (not epoch-specific), part of the [`rakurai_activation`](../rakurai_activation/README.md) program. This account controls whether the validator is running the Rakurai scheduler (and should be charged commission).

---

## 3. Epoch flow

### 3.1. RewardCollectionAccount account initialization
On the first turn of each epoch, the `RewardCollectionAccount` is automatically initialized by the Rakurai Solana client. This initialization includes:
- Commission details (from validator-specific [`RakuraiActivationAccount`](../rakurai_activation/README.md)).
- Authority to update the reward Merkle root (only this authority can upload the Merkle root to the `RewardCollectionAccount` account).
> Account initialization logic is part of the Rakurai Solana client.


### 3.2. Per-turn transfers
During every leader turn:
- The **previous turn's block reward** is processed:
  - **Client commission** → transferred to client (i.e., Rakurai) account.
  - **Validator commission** → remains in the validator's identity account.
  - **Staker share** → accumulated into the `RewardCollectionAccount`.

> Because the reward of the current turn is transferred during the next one, the **first turn** of an epoch handles the **last reward** of the previous epoch.

---

### 3.3. Post-epoch staker distribution
At the final slot of each epoch, the following process takes place:
- A snapshot of Solana accounts is captured.
- Each validator's staker details and stake weights are extracted.
- An off-chain Merkle tree is generated containing reward share data.
  - **Extra flexibility**: At this stage, specific stakers can be blacklisted, and individual stake weights can be adjusted before finalizing the tree.
- The Merkle root is uploaded to the `RewardCollectionAccount` by the `reward_merkle_root_authority`.
- Stakers receive rewards via Merkle claims. When `reward_merkle_root_authority` is Rakurai, Rakurai runs the claim process on behalf of stakers.


## 4. Reward Distribution — Free and Automated by Rakurai

- Set the Merkle root authority to `--rewards-merkle-root-authority` to `H21wFgN53ghjDq5N9QhraAiPn1tRVYkobySj55unXLEj` for fully automated reward distribution.
- Keep it yourself if you want to run distribution manually.

When set to **Rakurai**, Rakurai will automatically:

1. **Create a snapshot**
2. **Calculate the Merkle root**
3. **Upload it on-chain**
4. **Run the claim process for stakers**

<p style="font-size:14px;">
    <span style="color:#66ff66;"><i><b>0% distribution fees charged by Rakurai</b></i></span>
    — only standard Solana transaction fees apply.
</p>

### 4.1. Client commission on MEV rewards

The client charges commission on MEV Rewards **only** if the following conditions are met:

- The validator is actively running **Rakurai during that epoch**.  
- The validator has set a non-zero **MEV commission** in their **Tip Distribution Account**.

*Note:* If the validator’s MEV commission is **0%**, Rakurai does **not** charge any commission on MEV tips.

---

### 4.2. Deduction flow

1. The validator’s share of MEV tips is credited to their **vote account** by the Tip Distribution Program in the following epoch.  
2. A `ClaimStatus` account is created to track that the validator has received MEV rewards.  
3. Rakurai client monitors the `ClaimStatus` account; once it is created, then it is eligible to deduct commission.  
4. Rakurai cannot deduct directly from the vote account, so the **same commission amount** is deducted from the validator’s **identity account** instead.  
5. The deduction is performed by invoking the `transfer_client_commission_on_mev_commission` instruction in the **Reward Distribution Program**.  
6. The commission rate is defined in the **Reward Distribution Config account**.

---

## 5. Tip and MevShare collection accounts

Most tip revenue flows through accounts controlled by the [Rakurai Tip Manager Program](../rakurai_tip_manager/README.md). For revenue that lands in accounts Rakurai does **not** control, this program tracks on-chain tip and MevShare revenue in per-validator, per-service **Tips Collection Accounts (TCA)** and **MevShare Collection Accounts (MCA)**.

Defaults for TCA/MCA init live on the **`TipsAndMevShareConfigAccount`** singleton (`initialize_revenue_share_account_v1`).

Both use the same underlying `RevenueShareAccount`, parameterized by `share_kind ∈ {Tip, MevShare}` and exposed as the type aliases **`TipsCollectionAccount` (TCA)** and **`MevShareCollectionAccount` (MCA)**. Each account is uniquely tied to one validator, one transaction-landing or post-pack service, and one share kind — one TCA or MCA per `(service, validator)` pair.

### 5.1. Why a Tips Collection Account (TCA)

By default, services tip Rakurai's [eight tip accounts](../rakurai_tip_manager/README.md), and `rakurai_tip_manager` drains them automatically. But an external transaction-landing service can [register their own custom tip account](https://docs.rakurai.io/docs/services/rakurai_jito_private/rakurai_docs/transaction_inclusion/rakurai_tip_manager_faqs) and agree to share a commission (e.g. 30%) with Rakurai.

In that case **the tip is received in the external account holder's own account**, not in a Rakurai tip account. So Rakurai can't just drain it — instead the validator **records** the attributed amount on-chain in the per-validator, per-service TCA ledger each leader turn, and after the epoch the external account holder **settles** their agreed share into the Tips Collection Account PDA, from which the commission is deducted.

### 5.2. Why a MevShare Collection Account (MCA)

Same idea for [post-pack confirmations](https://docs.rakurai.io/docs/services/rakurai_jito_private/rakurai_docs/transaction_inclusion/post_pack_confirmations). The MevShare revenue lands in the transaction-landing or post-pack service's own flow, so there is no account Rakurai can drain. When you start using **post-pack**, Rakurai creates an MCA for your service (one per service per validator). That MCA is where you **record** MevShare revenue and **transfer** the corresponding SOL. You **must hold the MCA `record_authority`** — only that keypair can call `record_revenue` / Partner CLI `record-revenue`.

Unlike TCA, **nothing is recorded in the MCA during leader turns**. After the epoch ends, the service **records** the owed amount in the MCA **once** via `record_revenue`, then **settles** by transferring SOL into the PDA. See the [Partner Tip and MevShare Revenue Settlement CLI](../../cli/partner_reward_settlement.md#mca-setup-post-pack).

### 5.3. How Tip and MevShare are distributed

**TCA (custom tips):** the validator **records** attributed amounts in the TCA ledger on each leader turn. After the epoch ends, the tip account holder **settles** by transferring SOL into the TCA, then `claim_revenue` distributes it.

**MCA (post-pack / MevShare):** when post-pack starts, Rakurai creates the MCA; the service must hold `record_authority`. Nothing is recorded during leader turns. After the epoch ends, the service **records** the owed amount in the MCA **once**, **settles** by transferring SOL into the MCA, then `claim_revenue` distributes it.

Once settled (TCA or MCA), revenue is split in two parts:
 - **Client** (i.e. Rakurai): share of the claim goes to `commission_account` at `commission_bps`.
 - **Validator**: the remaining share is credited to its identity account.
   - The validator further has the option to convert the credited amount into block rewards. If enabled, once claimed, the claimed amount is converted into a high-priority block reward. The high-priority transaction is sent from the validator's identity account (because the amount was credited into the identity), and the transaction is guaranteed to land within the leader turn — it is created in the first turn of the leader slot, and the blockhash protects it so that if it does not land within those slots, it expires.

**Rakurai vault claim exception:** when `share_kind == Tip` and `name == RAKURAI_REVENUE_NAME`, both `claim_revenue` and `claim_revenue_v1` force effective `commission_bps = 0`. Tip-manager drain (`change_tip_receiver_v1` / `v2`) already took Rakurai’s cut using tip-manager global commission (previous leader’s TCA terms); the vault only holds the validator share. Applying commission again at claim would double-charge. Partner / custom TCA and MCA vaults still apply `commission_bps` at claim.

**Note:** If a service does not record and settle within 2 epochs, post-pack access and MCA prioritization stop after a two-epoch grace period.

Partners settle TCA/MCA balances with the [Partner Tip and MevShare Revenue Settlement CLI](../../cli/partner_reward_settlement.md) (`rakurai-revshare`: `get-account`, `get-all-accounts`, `get-pending-record`, `get-all-pending-records`, `record-revenue` for MCA, `transfer`, `transfer-all`).

### 5.4. Flow

| Step | Legacy TCA/MCA (`REVENUE_SHARE`) | TCAV1 / MCAV1 (`REVENUE_SHARE_V1`) |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Config** | RD config + full init args | One-time `initialize_tips_and_mev_share_config` |
| **Init** | `initialize_revenue_share_account` | `initialize_revenue_share_account_v1` |
| **Record** | `record_revenue` (amount only) | `record_revenue_v1` (Rakurai tip also credits `transferred_amount`) |
| **Settle** | N/A (claim needs vault lamports ≥ `amount`) | `settle_revenue` / `update_transferred_amount` |
| **Claim** | `claim_revenue` (pays `amount`) | `claim_revenue_v1` (pays `transferred_amount`; deficit; Rakurai name skips commission) |
| **Clear deficit** | — | `clear_deficit_v1` (funder transfers; deduct up to deficit → commission + identity) |
| **Close** | `close_revenue_share_account` | `close_revenue_share_account_v1` |

### 5.5. TipsAndMevShareConfigAccount

Singleton PDA (`TIPS_AND_MEV_SHARE_CONFIG`) holding Tip and MevShare defaults copied onto TCA/MCA at `initialize_revenue_share_account_v1`:

| Side | Fields copied at init_v1 |
|------|--------------------------|
| Tip | `tip_manager_authority`, `tip_commission_account`, `tip_commission_bps`, `tip_epoch` → `max_epoch_entries` |
| MevShare | `mev_share_manager_authority`, `mev_share_commission_*`, `mev_share_epoch` |

`record_authority` is passed as an instruction argument to `initialize_revenue_share_account_v1` (same as legacy init).

Instructions: `initialize_tips_and_mev_share_config`, `update_tips_and_mev_share_config`, `close_tips_and_mev_share_config`.

### 5.6. RevenueShareAccount / RevenueShareAccountV1 structure

**Legacy** `RevenueShareAccount` (aliases TCA / MCA) and **V1** `RevenueShareAccountV1` (aliases TCAV1 / MCAV1) share the same header fields. V1 adds per-entry `transferred_amount` (via `RevenueLedgerV1` / `EpochAmountEntryV1`) and account-level `deficit`. See the [Reward Distribution IDL](./idl/reward_distribution.json).

**Shared header fields** (both layouts):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `share_kind` | `RevenueKind` | `Tip` or `MevShare`; part of PDA seeds |
| `name` | `[u8; 32]` | UTF-8 padded label; Rakurai vaults use `RAKURAI_REVENUE_NAME` (`rakurai`) |
| `validator_vote` | `pubkey` | Validator vote account this account is tied to |
| `initializer` | `pubkey` | Account that paid to create the PDA; receives rent on close |
| `manager_authority` | `pubkey` | Signs `claim_revenue`, config updates, and close |
| `record_authority` | `pubkey` | Signs `record_revenue` — each leader turn for TCA; once post-epoch for MCA |
| `max_epoch_entries` | `u8` | Max distinct epochs stored in `ledger` (up to 32) |
| `commission_bps` | `u16` | Commission on claims; remainder goes to validator. Forced to 0 at claim when `name == RAKURAI_REVENUE_NAME` (Rakurai tip commission was already taken on tip-manager drain) |
| `commission_account` | `pubkey` | Receives the commission portion on claim |
| `block_reward_conversion_enabled` | `bool` | When true, claimed amounts can be marked converted via `update_epoch_converted_to_block_reward` |
| `bump` | `u8` | PDA bump seed |

**Legacy-only vs V1-only:**

| Field | Legacy (`RevenueShareAccount`) | V1 (`RevenueShareAccountV1`) |
|-------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `ledger` | `RevenueLedger` → `Vec<EpochAmountEntry>` | `RevenueLedgerV1` → `Vec<EpochAmountEntryV1>` |
| `deficit` | — | `u64` cumulative unpaid shortfall; manager write-off via `update_deficit`; funder clear via `clear_deficit_v1` |

**Ledger entry layouts:**

```rust
// Legacy — no transferred_amount
pub struct EpochAmountEntry {
    pub epoch: u64,
    pub amount: u64,                  // attributed lamports (updated by record_revenue)
    pub claimed: bool,
    pub block_reward_converted: bool,
}

// V1 — settle tracking
pub struct EpochAmountEntryV1 {
    pub epoch: u64,
    pub amount: u64,                  // attributed lamports (updated by record_revenue)
    pub transferred_amount: u64,      // settle_revenue, or auto on record_revenue for Rakurai tip TCA
    pub claimed: bool,
    pub block_reward_converted: bool,
}
```

**Example V1 ledger after `record_revenue` + partial settle:**

```json
{
  "deficit": 0,
  "ledger": {
    "entries": [
      { "epoch": 998, "amount": 500000000, "transferred_amount": 300000000, "claimed": false, "block_reward_converted": false },
      { "epoch": 997, "amount": 1200000000, "transferred_amount": 1200000000, "claimed": true, "block_reward_converted": false }
    ]
  }
}
```

`record_revenue` / `record_revenue_v1` updates `amount`. For the **Rakurai tip TCAV1** only, `record_revenue_v1` also credits `transferred_amount` (tip-manager deposits SOL in the same drain tx). Non-Rakurai V1 vaults call `settle_revenue` (system-transfer + credit) or `update_transferred_amount` (credit only, after a direct SOL send). `claim_revenue_v1` pays `transferred_amount`, accrues `deficit` when underfunded (`amount > transferred`), and sets `claimed = true`. Later shortfalls can be settled with `clear_deficit_v1` (funder transfers; vault deducts up to deficit and pays commission + identity). Legacy `claim_revenue` pays recorded `amount` and has no `deficit` / `transferred_amount`.

### 5.7. How to check status

- Solscan PDA tool: https://solscan.io/tools#pda-create
- **Legacy TCA/MCA:** `[REVENUE_SHARE, TIP|MEV_SHARE, name[32], validator_vote]`
- **TCAV1 / MCAV1:** `[REVENUE_SHARE_V1, TIP|MEV_SHARE, name[32], validator_vote]`

### 5.8. Dual vaults (legacy vs V1)

| | Seeds | Type | Tip manager |
|--|-------|------|-------------|
| Legacy | `[REVENUE_SHARE, TIP\|MEV_SHARE, name, vote]` | `RevenueShareAccount` | `change_tip_receiver_v1` + `record_revenue` |
| V1 | `[REVENUE_SHARE_V1, TIP\|MEV_SHARE, name, vote]` | `RevenueShareAccountV1` | `change_tip_receiver_v2` + `record_revenue_v1` |

Old validator releases keep using legacy PDAs and original ix names. New releases init TCAV1 and use `_v1` / TM `change_tip_receiver_v2`. Close unused legacy vaults with `close_revenue_share_account` when ready.

SDK: `derive_revenue_share_account_address` (legacy), `derive_revenue_share_account_v1_address` (V1).

## 6. Account lifecycle

### 6.1. Reward Collection Account (RCA)
- `RewardCollectionAccount` is valid for **2 epochs**.
- After that:
  - Any unclaimed funds are returned to the **validator's identity account**.
  - The account is closed to reclaim rent.

### 6.2. Tip and MevShare collection accounts

Legacy and V1 vaults coexist. Each is created once per `(seed space, share_kind, name, vote)`. Manager authority closes them when unused.

---

## 7. P2C subscription escrow

Prepaid fee escrow for Pack-to-Chain (P2C) billing, keyed as `[P2C_SUBSCRIPTION, name, vote]`.

| Step | Instruction | Auth |
|------|-------------|------|
| Init | `initialize_p2c_subscription_account` | **manager only** (signs + pays rent) |
| Fund | `fund_p2c_subscription` | any funder |
| Record | `record_p2c_subscription` | `record_authority` |
| Deduct | `deduct_p2c_subscription` | manager (partial OK) |
| Claim | `claim_p2c_subscription` | manager |
| Clear deficit | `clear_p2c_deficit` | any funder (transfer in, program deducts + pays commission/identity) |
| BR flag | `update_p2c_epoch_converted_to_block_reward` | manager / record / identity |
| Config / deficit write-off / close | `update_p2c_subscription_config`, `update_p2c_deficit`, `close_p2c_subscription_account` | manager |

- **Partial deduct**: `amount_deducted += min(remaining_due, free_balance)` — still succeeds when underfunded; top-up and re-deduct while unclaimed.
- **Claim** pays only `amount_deducted` (`commission_bps` → commission, rest → identity). Unpaid rem → `deficit` + grace (`Active` / `InGrace` / `Suspended`, default grace = 2).
- **Clear deficit**: `clear_p2c_deficit(amount)` — funder transfers; program deducts up to open deficit, splits to commission + validator identity, reduces `deficit`. Clearing to 0 resets grace to `Active`.
- **Close** requires all ledger epochs claimed; residual SOL + rent → initializer.
- **Convert-to-block** same post-claim flag as TCA/MCA.
